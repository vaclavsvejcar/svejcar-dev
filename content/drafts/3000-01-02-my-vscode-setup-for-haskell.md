When I started to learn [Haskell][web:haskell], I hoped that I'll be able to get similar _IDE_ experience as I have with [Scala][web:scala] and [IntelliJ Idea][web:idea]. Unfortunately the opposite was true. There are some _Haskell_ plugins for _Idea_, but none of them worked for me (mostly due to crashes or hangs) and they seem to be pretty immature as well. But I found pretty good feedback on using _VSCode_ for _Haskell_ development, so I tried it and with help of few _plugins_, you get pretty decent _IDE-like_ experience with syntax highlighting, error reporting and code completion. In this blogpost, I'll present my _VSCode_ setup I use for (almost) everyday _Haskell_ developing.

# Installation steps
Please note that I use _macOS_ as my operating system so some things in this blog post may be _macOS-specific_. However, most things (except installing dependencies) should be similar for any OS.
