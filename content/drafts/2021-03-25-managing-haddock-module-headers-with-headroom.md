Managing copyright/license headers in source code files of larger project can be tedious job. There are some tools available that can automate this process, but such tools are usually pretty simple and all they do is to take header template, fill in some variable values and place it to all source code files. This is fine for plain copyright/license headers, but for something more complex like [Haddock module header][web/haddock-module-header] such tools are not sufficient. In this article, I'll introduce [Headroom][github/headroom] and show how it can easily manage headers even of large [Haskell][web/haskell] projects.
