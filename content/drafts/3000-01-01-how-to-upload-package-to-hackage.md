Few months ago I decided to learn [Haskell][web:haskell] and from very first pieces of _Hello World_ like code snippets I progressed to writting my very first real world utility called [Headroom][github:headroom] (more about it in next blog post). So now, it's available on [Github][web:github], but it's more common for Haskell projects to be also available on [Hackage][web:hackage]. In this blog post, I'll summary my journey and write down all important steps, both as reminder for myself and hopefully as help for someone else.
